vs-configs
==========

Forked this project to edit the CSS stylesheets for the Syntax Highlighter.

I'm not sure if I have Syntax Highlighter configured wrong, or if I'm using a later version than aarondandy did (and the CSS paths changed), but I don't really have time to figure that out, so I've just added my changes to the end of the file.

Eventually, I'll merge the changes into the original styles to make it more efficient.
